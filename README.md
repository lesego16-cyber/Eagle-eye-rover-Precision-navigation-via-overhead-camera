# Eagle-eye-rover-Precision-navigation-via-overhead-camera
This repository contains my Final Year Engineering Research project: a low-cost rover system that integrates an external high-resolution overhead camera with ultrasonic sensors for precise autonomous navigation. 

## Key Features
- **High-Precision Navigation**: ±0.5 cm positioning accuracy
- **Real-Time Vision Processing**: OpenCV-based object tracking
- **Smartphone Control Interface**: Target selection via mobile app
- **Multi-Sensor Fusion**: Camera + ultrasonic sensor integration
- **Distributed Architecture**: Laptop server + microcontroller for real-time performance

## Technical Implementation
- **Computer Vision**: Zhang's calibration method, color tracking
- **Control Systems**: PID and proportional control strategies  
- **Communication**: WiFi-based real-time data transmission
- **Sensors**: USB webcam + HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensors

## Results & Performance
- Positioning accuracy: (10 ± 0.5) cm from target
- Image processing latency: 7.71 ms average
- Video transmission latency: 3.32 ms average
- Command execution latency: 275.28 ms average
- Successful obstacle avoidance in dynamic environments
